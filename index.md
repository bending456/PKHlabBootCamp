## Introduction
This github page will provide python boot camp useful for our computational research. 

Our lab is a computation-oriented research group that spends most of its time developing and implementing computational methods for physiology-related research. 
Most folks in the PKH group utilize python as a primary programming language for various purposes, such as automating computation processes, post molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, machine learning, presenting data, etc. 
In this tutorial webpage, therefore, we intend to provide useful materials for learning python. 

Before we start, if you are not familiar with python or have not installed it on your PC, please choose the following option. 
1. [Colaboratory a.k.a. Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb): This is Colab powered by Google. Colab is a cloud-based python engine linked with your Google account. That said, you can use your Google drive as your storage, which starts from 15 GB as a bundle package. Once you are familiar with python and generating output files, please make sure you download or move them to your Google drive. 
2. [Kaggle](https:/kaggle.com): Kaggle is like Khan Academy. They provide python tutorials where you can do hands-on practice at various levels. This website is one of the most recommended self-learning websites by computer scientists/engineers in the industry. 

## How to follow this website
1. On the left tab (or bottom of this page), there is a list of content, starting from: 
- python basic 
- crucial mathematical concept to understand 
- physiology and math 
- how to convert math to python 
- couple things to know in python, and 
- application. 

2. Besides, we are also providing extra practice you may be interested in as an additional activity. 
3. On the top, there are four links we provide quick access to Colab website, PKH lab website, PKH lab wiki (if available for you), and department website. 


### This website may not provide a complete description of python syntax. For this reason, we highly recommend our audiences click the links we suggest during the course for clarity.
