## Python Basic

The following link is created in Notebooks.ai that was one of the most convenient cloud-based python user interface... but I think they got shut down for some reason. Though, you can still read the lecture note linked below.
- [Python Basics](https://notebooks.ai/Beth1126/pda-intro-to-python-webinar-2020-15cbfec7)

The author of this tutorial is my fellow post-doc researcher at UIC, Bethany Baumann. 
She used this as one of the lecture series during Chicago Area Postdoc Webinar 2020. 
She compiled python basics from various sources (**she listed sources she learned from in her lecture note**), and the level of detail is very comprehensive. 

If you guys are willing to challenge yourself, please check out the following link where Beth compiled some useful data sorting scripts in python.

If these are too difficult to follow and you need interactive lecture, then please check out Kaggle.
